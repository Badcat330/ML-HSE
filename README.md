# Practical DL Course

This repository was created for DL seminars taught at HSE for first-year undergraduates in the Data Science program. The seminars is an addition to the lecture course by Sergey Nikolenko: https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~sergey/teaching/mlspsu2022.html

The seminars contain material on topics: 
* Introduction to numpy, 
* Visualization libraries, 
* Introduction to Pandas, 
* Itroduction to the classification problem, 
* Decision trees, KNN models,
* Linear models, regularization, 
* Learning metrics,
* Bagging, 
* Feature importance, 
* PCA, K-means, 
* as well as a discussion of ordinary problems from interviews and their solution.

Used links for seminars:
* YDSA ML Handbook : https://academy.yandex.ru/handbook/ml 
* New articles, SoTA code : https://arxiv.org/ , https://www.researchgate.net/ , https://paperswithcode.com/sota 
* Interview resources : https://github.com/cdeweyx/DS-Career-Resources/blob/master/Interview-Resources.md

The continuation of the course will be Deep Learning in the 3rd, 4th modules of the first-year DS program.
